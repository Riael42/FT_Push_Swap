#42's Push Swap

A project about sorting integers in two stacks using 11 instructions
I have instead solved it via Radix sorting only using 5 of those instructions
and storing the information inside of arrays instead of linked lists.
Of course, due to only using less than 50% of the given resources it is not 
the most efficient algorithm out there.
